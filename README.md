🛡️ AEGIS ULTRA: SOVEREIGN FORENSIC ENGINE
"Vigilantia et Integritas"

Developed by Bilel Jelassi, Aegis Ultra is a high-performance, Zero-Trust forensic auditor designed to restore total sovereignty over the Windows operating system. It moves beyond simple "cleaning" to perform deep-state auditing of kernel integrity, network perimeters, and hardware health.

### 1.💎 Elite Forensic Phases
Aegis Ultra executes a 10-phase security protocol to ensure no threat remains hidden:

* Identity Audit: Validates digital signatures of core System32 DLLs to prevent hijacking.

* Sovereign Check: Scans for "Shadow Administrators" with a whitelist for the owner (Billy_Pc).

* Perimeter Audit: Maps network listeners to verified publisher signatures.

* Persistence Hunt: Uncovers hidden scripts (PowerShell/CMD) in the Windows Task Scheduler.

* WMI Stalking: Detects fileless "hooks" in the WMI Event Consumer database.

* S.M.A.R.T. Telemetry: Direct hardware health analysis of NVMe/SSD wear levels.

* Kernel Reconstruction: Automated SFC repair of corrupted OS "DNA" with a visual progress spinner.

* Artifact Decimation: Purges system "Dropper" locations and temporary bloat.

* Vulnerability Probe: Internal Nmap-style scan with CVE Intelligence (e.g., EternalBlue, BlueKeep).

* Sovereignty Purge: Flushes DNS and resets the Winsock stack to kill malicious redirects.

## 📖 Decoding the Report
You don't need to be an expert to understand Aegis Ultra. Here is the "Cheat Sheet":

* **[SEC] (Security Audit):** The Detective mode. Inspecting deep system files for signs of tampering.
* **[INFO] (Information):** Standard maintenance (cleaning cache, checking hardware health).
* **WMI Persistence:** This is a "Hidden Trigger." Hackers use WMI to make malware stay on your PC even after you delete it. We find and expose these triggers.
* **Shadow Admin:** Accounts with "God Mode" powers. We ensure you are the only one with total control of your PC.

### 3. ⚖️ Philosophy

This tool is built on the Zero-Trust Framework. It treats every background process, task, and network port as a potential threat until its identity is cryptographically verified. Unlike standard tools, Aegis Ultra does not rely on third-party APIs like VirusTotal, ensuring your data remains private and your audit remains local and stealthy.

"The price of sovereignty is eternal vigilance."
